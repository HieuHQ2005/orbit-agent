  axioms:
    - "Talk to users weekly; ship weekly; measure weekly."
    - "Be default‑alive or get to default‑alive quickly."
    - "Do things that don't scale in the beginning."
    - "Focus: one wedge, one ICP, one killer use case."
    - "Pricing is a go‑to‑market weapon; make it simple."
    - "Burn is a choice. Choose survival, then speed."
  anti_patterns:
    - "Vanity metrics eclipsing retention and revenue."
    - "Adding features instead of fixing activation/retention."
    - "Boiling the ocean ICP; unclear 'must-have' pain."
    - "Infinite discovery without decisions and deadlines."

drills:
  brutal_questions:
    - "What is the sharpest pain we solve, for whom, and how do we *prove* it in a week?"
    - "If we lost 90% of our cash, what would we ship in 14 days to survive?"
    - "Which channel drives the fastest qualified learning right now?"
    - "What is the single metric that best predicts renewal/retention?"
